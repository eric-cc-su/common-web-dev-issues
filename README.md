# common-web-dev-issues
A repository of the common web dev issues and solutions that web developers often deal with.
 
[original article](http://ericsu.me/tech/2016/01/25/common-web-dev-issues.html)

So you're having some issues in your web environment. Before you start diving
deep into documentation and Stack Overflow, check this guide to make sure you're not
experiencing one of the really simple configuration issues that countless people have most likely experienced
before. 

**Each Markdown file is a guide (e.g. django.md is the Django guide)**. If there are code examples that readers might find
useful I will create directories to contain those.

This is basically a reminder to myself for stupid things that I personally run into, so I might have left
out some other issues that other developers or other configurations experience. If you are a developer who would
like to contribute, I would greatly appreciate your pull requests.

## Guides
- [General](guides/general.md)
- [Django](guides/django.md)
- [Javascript/jQuery](guides/javascript.md)
- [MySQL](guides/mysql.md)

*This repo will continue to be updated as I find or remember more typical issues*
